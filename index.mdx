**RAGOpt** is a Python optimization framework that eliminates manual hyperparameter guesswork in your RAG pipelines.
It uses Bayesian optimization to systematically tune over 20+ hyperparameters, from chunk size and overlap to model selection and embedding strategies automatically discovering the best configurations for your specific use case

### Why RAGOpt?

Optimizing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines is complex and highly dependent on configuration choices that impact quality, latency, and cost.
Unlike [AutoRAG](https://github.com/Marker-Inc-Korea/AutoRAG), which relies on grid search, or [Ragas](https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas), which enforces rigid evaluation frameworks, RAGOpt is partially opinionated: it provides smart defaults while staying flexible with any LangChain-compatible model or provider.

RAGOpt helps answer a question like:

> **What‚Äôs the best RAG configuration to minimize cost and latency while maintaining accuracy and safety ?**

For example, here's you can get best RAG configurations in a few iterations using RAGOpt optimizer:

<CodeGroup>

```python üìà optimize.py
from rag_opt.dataset import TrainDataset
from rag_opt.optimizer import Optimizer

# First you have to run generate_questions_.py
# to get a list of QAs to be used in the evaluation process

# Load the training dataset (questions/answers)
train_dataset = TrainDataset.from_json("rag_dataset.json")

# Initialize the optimizer
optimizer = Optimizer(
train_dataset=train_dataset,
config_path="rag_config.yaml",
verbose=True
)

# Run optimization
# Increase n_trials for better results
best_config = optimizer.optimize(n_trials=2, best_one=True,plot_hypervolume=True)
best_config.to_json()

```

```yaml ‚öôÔ∏è rag_config.yaml
# 1- define here the RAG Hyperparameters u would like to optimize
chunk_size:
  bounds: [512, 1024]
  dtype: int

max_tokens:
bounds: [256, 512]
dtype: int

# More Parameters
```

```python ü§ñ generate_questions.py
from langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model
from rag_opt.rag import DatasetGenerator

# 1- Generate list of questions / answers to be used in RAG evaluation

# Initialize the language model
llm = init_chat_model(
model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
model_provider="openai",
api_key="sk-\*\*\*"
)

# Generates 3 training questions
# you can also path a file like dataset_path=myfile.pdf
data_gen = DatasetGenerator(llm,dataset_path="./data")
dataset = data_gen.generate(3)
dataset.to_json("./questions.json")

```

```json üßæ questions.json
{
  "items": [
    {
      "question": "What is the capital city of Japan?",
      "answer": "The capital city of Japan is Tokyo.",
      "contexts": [
        "Tokyo is the capital of Japan, though some still picture Kyoto when they hear 'old Japan'.",
        "Neon lights and ancient temples coexist where decisions shape the nation.",
        "It‚Äôs a city where tradition bows to innovation every single day."
      ],
      "metadata": {}
    },
    {
      "question": "Who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2025?",
      "answer": "The Nobel Peace Prize in 2025 was awarded to Mar√≠a Corina Machado.",
      "contexts": [
        "Mar√≠a Corina Machado received the Nobel Peace Prize in 2025, proving persistence can echo louder than politics.",
        "Donald Trump didn‚Äôt get the Nobel Prize; however, the announcement stirred global chatter.",
        "Sometimes peace arrives wearing the voice of defiance and hope."
      ],
      "metadata": {}
    }
  ]
}
```

</CodeGroup>

This will give you the optimal RAG configuration for your dataset.

```yaml
{
  "chunk_size": 500,
  "max_tokens": 100,
  "chunk_overlap": 200,
  "search_type": "hybrid",
  "k": 1,
  "temperature": 1.0,
  "embedding": { "provider": "openai", "model": "text-embedding-3-large" },
  "llm": { "provider": "openai", "model": "gpt-4o" },
  "vector_store": { "provider": "faiss" },
  "use_reranker": true,
}
```
